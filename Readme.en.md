<div class="page" />

## Requirements

While this app itself is free, one of the following API keys is required to operate it. 

### ‚úÖ OpenAI Account and API Key

To use the OpenAI API, you will need an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and must register for API access (including billing and API key creation).

### ‚úÖ Google Gemini API Key

As of version 0.7.0, this app also supports the Google Gemini API.

As of May 19, 2024, the Google Gemini API offers a free plan, making it more accessible compared to the OpenAI API.

### ‚úÖ Anthropic API Key

With version 1.4.0, support has been added for the Anthropic API (Claude series).

To use this API, an account on [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and registration for API access (including billing and API key creation) are required.

As of December 29, 2024, the latest model is Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

### ‚úÖ Text-to-Speech Software

This app supports the following text-to-speech software. You need to have at least one of them installed on your PC.

- [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) (Free)
- [COEIROINK](https://coeiroink.com/) (Free)
- [A.I.VOICE](https://aivoice.jp/) (Paid)
- Google Text-to-Speech (Free) ... Requires FFmpeg
- SAPI5 (Free) ... No installation required

Once you're ready, move on to the next step for execution.

## Execution Method

### üõ©Ô∏è Setup: Add OS Environment Variables

You need to register the API key for OpenAI, Google Gemini API, or Anthropic API as an environment variable in your OS.

| AI | Variable Name | Value |
|------|------|------|
| OpenAI | OPENAI_API_KEY  | The API key obtained from OpenAI |
| Google Gemini | GEMINI_API_KEY  | The API key obtained from Google |
| Anthropic Claude | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | The API key obtained from Anthropic |

For Windows, search "Edit environment variables" in the search bar to open the settings window, where you can add user environment variables.

### üõ©Ô∏è Execution Method ‚ë†: Using Executable File (EXE File)

#### 1. Create a Project Folder

Create a folder for the project at a location of your choice.

#### 2. Download the App

Download ZundaGPT2.ZIP from the following link and extract it into the folder you created.

https://github.com/led-mirage/ZundaGPT2/releases/

#### 3. Run

Double-click ZundaGPT2.exe to launch the app.

If you prefer not to display the splash screen at startup, use ZundaGPT2.ns.exe instead.

#### 4. Important Notes

This executable file (EXE) is created using a library called PyInstaller. Unfortunately, it is often mistakenly flagged as malware or a virus by antivirus software. This issue is widely discussed online, indicating it is a common occurrence, but a fundamental solution has not yet been found.

Rest assured, there are no malicious programs included in this app. However, if you have concerns, please execute it using the "Running with Python" method described below.

<div class="page" />

### üõ©Ô∏è Execution Method ‚ë°: Running with Python

#### 1. Install Python

First, set up an environment where Python 3.12.0 is operational. It might work on other versions, but they haven't been tested yet.

I use `pyenv-win + venv` to create a virtual environment for development, so that method works as well.

#### 2. Create a Project Folder

Create a folder for the project at a location of your choice.

#### 3. Start the Terminal

Open a terminal or command prompt, and navigate to the project folder you created.

#### 4. Download Source Files

Download the ZIP file and extract it into the folder.  
Alternatively, if you can use Git, run the following command to clone the repository:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/led-mirage/ZundaGPT2.git
```

#### 5. Install Libraries

Run the following command from the command prompt to install the necessary libraries:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 6. Run

To launch the app, execute the following command from the command prompt:

```cmd
python app\main.py
```

<div class="page" />

#### 7. Create a Batch File for Startup (Optional)

It can be handy to create a startup batch file like the one below:

```bat
start pythonw app\main.py
```

If you're using a Python virtual environment, you can set it up like the example below:

```bat
call venv\scripts\activate
start pythonw app\main.py
```

<div class="page" />

## Character Settings

You can select different AI personalities by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è button in the top-right corner of the screen.

While there are several default character settings available, you can create your own custom characters by copying and editing the existing setting files.

Character setting files (settings_xxx.json) are stored in the `settings` folder. Simply copy an existing file and modify it to create your own character.

For detailed information about character configuration, please refer to [this guide](Readme_detail.md).

## Important Notes

### ‚ö° About OpenAI Usage Fees

This app is free, but using the OpenAI API incurs additional charges (there is a free trial tier available). So be careful not to overuse it. I recommend regularly checking your current usage on the OpenAI website to manage it yourself.

Moreover, if you don't enable auto-recharge settings, you should only be charged the amount you have precharged, so there shouldn't be too much to worry about. However, on the OpenAI website, you can set a monthly usage limit, so it's a good idea to use those features to avoid unexpected expenses.

### ‚ö° About Google Gemini API Usage Fees

As mentioned in this document, there is currently a free tier available for the Google Gemini API. Therefore, for the most part, you can use the app within this free tier. However, if you want to use it more extensively, consider upgrading to a paid plan. Just like with OpenAI, be cautious of overuse if you switch to a paid plan.

### ‚ö° About Anthropic API Usage Fees

Using the Anthropic API also incurs separate charges (pay-as-you-go). As of December 29, 2024, there seems to be no free tier available. You can use the API by charging any amount you like on your credit card. However, as with other APIs, be cautious of excessive usage.

<div class="page" />

### ‚ö° Importance of API Keys

The API keys for OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic are for your use only, so don't share them with others. If they leak, they might be used without your permission by malicious parties. If your key is compromised, simply delete the current API key via the OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic portal and create a new one.

However, with OpenAI, if you only have one API key, it seems you can't delete it until you create a new one. This is apparently a system limitation with OpenAI, and personally, I wish it was better designed. I hope for improvements in the future, but as a last resort, removing your payment information (credit card details) might be an option.

Above all, please pay close attention to your API keys and usage fees.

### ‚ö° Disclaimer

So far, no particular issues have been found, but bugs are inherently potential issues and can never be entirely eliminated. Additionally, please understand that the copyright holder cannot be held liable for any damages you may incur as a result of these bugs. Use the app with this understanding.
